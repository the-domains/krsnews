            <description><![CDATA[<article><img src="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2008/01/11Oct07_Schwartz_manage-your-energy.png"><h1>Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time</h1><p>Steve Wanner is a highly respected 37-year-old partner at Ernst &amp; Young, married with four young children. When we met him a year ago, he was working 12- to 14-hour days, felt perpetually exhausted, and found it difficult to fully engage with his family in the evenings, which left him feeling guilty and dissatisfied ... The core problem with working longer hours is that time is a finite resource. Energy is a different story. Defined in physics as the capacity to work, energy comes from four main wellsprings in human beings: the body, emotions, mind, and spirit ...

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Career Limitations Of Emotional Intelligence</h1><p>Surely by now you&apos;ve heard: Highly emotionally intelligent people are more successful, and companies are bending over backward to recruit them. The term &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; (often abbreviated to EQ or EI) was first coined by the psychologist and former New York Times journalist Daniel Goleman in 1995, and while it&apos;s had its critics, the term&apos;s buzzword status hasn&apos;t relented much since.</p><img src="http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2016/05/3060123-poster-p-1-how-to-be-a-success-at-everythingthe-career-limitations-of-emotional-intelligence.jpg"></article>]]></description>
