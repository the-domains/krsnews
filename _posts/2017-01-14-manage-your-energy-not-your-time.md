This article highlights and explain some very usefull tools to recharge your energy levels and reduce the speed at which your energy reserve is depleted.

I highly suggest that you read the full article [here][0], or read the highlights that I find compelling below.

## Changing Lenses

> The most effective way people can change a story is to view it through any of three new lenses, which are all alternatives to seeing the world from the victim perspective. With the reverse lens, for example, people ask themselves, "What would the other person in this conflict say and in what ways might that be true?" With the long lens they ask, "How will I most likely view this situation in six months?" With the wide lens they ask themselves, "Regardless of the outcome of this issue, how can I grow and learn from it?" Each of these lenses can help people intentionally cultivate more positive emotions.
