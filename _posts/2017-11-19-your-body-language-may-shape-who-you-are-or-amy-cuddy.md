  Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see
  ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that "power posing" --
  standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can
  boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for
  success.
